- optimisation
    - XY Bounding box of some kind (solid angle?)
    - add some x/y boxing (Quadtree?) to cull items when tracing
    DONE - drop z-sorting
    - if we add bounding boxes, can we "super bound" higher level Items (like torus)
        - nested items, we hit the box, we look at the items in that box etc

    Each item can optionally have a "covering"
        - nil implies we always hit it at that level
        - allows complex objects to only be considered
        - need to maintain itemlist structure (rather than itemSource stuff into main list)

DONE - change colour of T3s / Kites?

DONE - want generic images on Kite3s
    - need uv?
    - accurate co-ords

- do some profiling

- add some shadows

- add a sphere

- add specular highlights?

- add reflections?
